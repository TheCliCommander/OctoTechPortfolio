				<div class="service">
					<h3>Development</h3>
					<p>I do everything from web design to app development. I create custom command line tools, and apps with 
					   sleek and modern UI's, both of which often utilize backend SQL databases. Whatever your need
					   I'm certain I can find a solution using one of the several programming languages with which I am familiar.
					   These include Python, C#, JavaScript, SQL(including Postgres, MySQL, SQLite), Bash, as well as 
					   markup languages like HTML and YAML, and of course style sheet languages like CSS. I will always
					   strive to find the most appropriate languages and tools for a given project and if that means learning a new
					   language I am not only capable but excited to do so in a timely manner. I love to design both the front end and 
					   backend aspects of applications, whether they be web apps, desktop apps, or mobile apps. I can do anything I set 
					   my mind to and look forward to learning along the way.

					<h3>Linux System Administration</h3>
					<p>I absolutley love Linux! I spent over 100 hours just taking video courses when I first met Tux. I've spent hundreds
					   more working on projects like setting up network fileshares between various devices and virtual machines, learning cyber security practices on
					   sites like hackthebox.com, overthewire.org, hackthissite.org and my favorite tryhackme.com. I started my adventures with python on a Linux
					   distro and my first few projects were ethical hacking tools like webcrawlers, vulnerability scanners, backdoor and listener etc. You can find
					   all of the code for these projects on my github:<a href="https://www.github.com/TheCliCommander">TheCliCommander</a>
					   I am well versed in setting up permissions for users, creating new users, setting passwords and switching to other users,
					   using the PS command to identify processes and kill them when necessary and can utilize Top to do the same. I can setup network 
					   connections via command line, change hostnames, use sticky bits, and all the nitty gritty important things involved with 
					   maintaining linux systems. I have even practiced keeping up with several VM's running at once with programs that intentionally
					   cause issues that need repair. I'm confident I would be a great sys-admin and am willing to start as a Jr. Sys Admin.

					<h3>E-Commerce</h3>
					<p>These days EVERYBODY wants an online store. Well look no further, I've got you covered. I will create you a fully functioning online shop equipped with user authentication, paypal, and a big splash of your personality to really make it your own. Check out my portfolio below for an example of one that resembles a certain major e-commerce site that virtually everyone uses.</p>

				'Self-Taught' Computer Whiz
			</p>

			<div class="about-me__body">
				<p>Thanks to the wonders of the internet I was able to research and teach myself several coding languages,
				   networking and security practices, and Linux System Administration. I've been in love with computers since
				   my father built our first home computer in the late 90's and learned my first bit of HTML way back then. I 
				   spent countless hours playing on the computer learning as much as I could using our dial-up internet. I was much
				   older when I finally got to really get into learning computer science but the interest was always there. I completed a
				   semester of college for Cyber Security and Networking but had to take a break because of unforseen events, I hope to one
				   day return. In the meantime I have been studying on my own to prepare for certifications and stay on track with the school
				   curriculum and beyond.
